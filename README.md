# Naming Conventions In Coding

Choosing the right naming convention is important for readability, consistency, and integration with other tools. Below are common naming conventions and when to use them:

## 1. kebab-case (Hyphen-separated)
- **How to write:** All lowercase letters, words separated by hyphens (`-`).
- **Example:** `my-awesome-project`
- **When to use:** This is the most common style on GitHub, easy to read and understand in URLs. Suitable for all types of repositories, especially when you want a clear and concise name.

## 2. snake_case (Underscore-separated)
- **How to write:** All lowercase letters, words separated by underscores (`_`).
- **Example:** `my_awesome_project`
- **When to use:** This style is common in languages like Python. If you want to keep your repository name consistent with your code or internal file structure, snake_case is a good choice.

## 3. camelCase (Lowercase first word, capitalized subsequent words)
- **How to write:** The first word is lowercase, and subsequent words are capitalized.
- **Example:** `myAwesomeProject`
- **When to use:** Typically used in JavaScript or frameworks like React. However, this style is less common for repository names as it can be harder to read in URLs.

## 4. PascalCase (Capitalized words)
- **How to write:** Each word starts with an uppercase letter.
- **Example:** `MyAwesomeProject`
- **When to use:** PascalCase is sometimes used for class names in languages like C# or Java. You might choose PascalCase for your repo if you want to align with your class naming conventions.

## 5. UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (Uppercase, underscore-separated)
- **How to write:** All uppercase letters, words separated by underscores (`_`).
- **Example:** `MY_AWESOME_PROJECT`
- **When to use:** This style is less common for repositories but might be used for large open-source projects or to emphasize important repositories.

## 6. no-case (No separator or special characters)
- **How to write:** All lowercase letters, no separators.
- **Example:** `myawesomeproject`
- **When to use:** This style is difficult to read but might be used if you want the shortest possible name. However, it's generally not recommended.

## 7. dot.case (Dot-separated)
- **How to write:** All lowercase letters, words separated by dots (`.`).
- **Example:** `my.awesome.project`
- **When to use:** This style is uncommon, but may be used in projects related to configuration files or microservices to maintain consistency with file naming conventions.
